# Prometheus OpenVPN exporter

This repository provides code for a simple Prometheus metrics exporter
for [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/). Right now it can parse files
generated by OpenVPN's `--status`, having one of the following formats:

* Client statistics,
* Server statistics with `--status-version 2` (comma delimited),
* Server statistics with `--status-version 3` (tab delimited).

As it is not uncommon to run multiple instances of OpenVPN on a single
system (e.g., multiple servers, multiple clients or a mixture of both),
this exporter can be configured to scrape and export the status of
multiple status files, using the `-openvpn.status_paths` command line
flag. Paths need to be comma separated.

Please refer to this utility's `main()` function for a full list of
supported command line flags.
